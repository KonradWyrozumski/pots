Installation
------------

This simulator comes with three different graphical systems.
The default is gs 1.1.

The graphical system may be changed by copying one of the files:

simulator.pxw  (pwx system)
simulator.gs10 (gs 1.0)
simulator.gs11 (gs 1.1)

to simulator.erl and then recompile simulator.
If you use the pxw system you need to modify the search path in configure.erl.


We have also supplied some solutions to the exercise.
