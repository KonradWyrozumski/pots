This program was originally used at Ericsson's Basic Erlang Course.
At the end of day two, you were assigned the task of completing 
a control program for the subscriber end of the POTS system.
There is a graphical simulator, but back then, you could also
use the pots program to drive an Ericsson MD101 phone switch
and make your own (very local) telephone calls in the lab!

The program contains enough interesting concurrency to illustrate
the problem of complexity explosion when using certain approaches.
Currently, there is very little documentation.
